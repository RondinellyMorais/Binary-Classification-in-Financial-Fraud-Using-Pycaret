### Pycaret is an auto-machine learning tool written in python that allows you to automate many data preparation processes. This library was inspired by the R language package caret. The main goal of pycaret is to reduce the cycle time from the hypothesis stage to the insights, increasing productivity considerably.

 ### The problem we will deal with is a typical binary classification problem. We have a dataset containing data about financial transactions made by customers through various banking services. The goal is to predict the occurrence of fraudulent transactions using machine learning models. The dataset consists of 7 columns with numeric values and a categorical column containing the two classes we want to predict.
 
 ### Binary classification is a type of supervised machine learning technique to predict the distribution between two distinct discrete classes. With respect to our particular problem we have two classes: one representing a legitimate transaction and one representing a fraudulent transaction. We will apply pycaret's features to treat the data passing all the necessary steps, from the treatment of missing values to the normalization of the values.
